## Hi, I'm Brenda! ${\textsf{\color{Purple}(they/them)}}$

### ðŸŒŸ About Me 

I am a STEM Posse 5 and Smith College Alum who has experience in a variety of frontend and backend programming languages, including Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, C++ and more! I have worked on compiling C++ based operational flight program models as a Software Engineer Intern and conducted mixed methods National Science Foundation-funded research to broaden participation in K-16 STEM education as a Research Assistant. In Fall 2023, I developed an interdisciplinary methodology using Black queer theory, Black feminist theory, and Human-Computer Interaction research to study how gender nonconforming Black and Latine gaming streamers generate and navigate digital versus physical spaces.
